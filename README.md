# GDS-Github-Trello

## The Problem
App that queries Github’s API to look at alphagov’s PRs, and when a link to a Trello card is mentioned in the PR, post a message to the team’s Trello board, with the reference of the PR.

## User Stories
As a GOV.UK developer

So that I can make sure that the Trello card I am working on has the correct PR information

I would like a link to relevant PRs to be automatically added to the Trello card.
